# Welcome to our Project Based on Classifying Lung X-Ray Images
## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses classifying lung x-ray images taken from here https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3 . For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preparation
3. Data Exploration
4. Classifying using Decision Trees
5. Classifying using Logistic Regression
6. Classifying using Deep Learning - Convolutional Neural Network
7. Comparing and Evaluating Models
8. Improvements to our method
